Steps to having your own Chopped challenge

# **Get judges**
Make sure to pick people who like all foods!

## **Find a place to cook**
Preferably with a double oven.

### **Choose reasonable times**
Can't actually do the time frame in TV show, so agree on reasonable time frames.
Can't be too long because people get satiated.
Don't need two different stoves, can just have half. May be crowded, but no one has two stoves.

#### **How to choose items**
Maybe find recipes from around the world and get unique combos from them. Good to try to get something sweet or sour in each round; something with an extreme flavor different to all other items will challenge the chefs to be creative. Another good idea is to get food that are either pre-made or REALLY associated with one food type.
